Subject: [PATCH 28/28] Enable _tkinter for ARM64 Windows

The upstream Python build system excludes _tkinter for ARM and ARM64
platforms due to historical lack of Tcl/Tk support. Since we now have
Tcl/Tk packages built for win-arm64, enable _tkinter on ARM64.

Keep the ARM (32-bit) exclusion as that platform is not targeted.
